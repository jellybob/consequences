They resolved to marry without delay
They never spoke of that day again
They formed a country-singing duo and toured rural America
They formed a heavy metal band and toured the world
She hit him with her handbag
They founded a new religion
They fell about laughing
It ran in all the newspapers
There was a national scandal
They went for an impromptu swim
They were both deeply embarrassed
They were never seen again
They were never the same again
They bought a flat together
They became the best of friends
They had a tickle fight
They became a crime-fighting duo
They had their own television programme
